# FirmwareTY71M
Firmware for NUC122 based keyboards (eg. drevo calibur)

This project aims to create a simple firmware for the ty71 keyboard board used for example in the drevo calibur.
If possible the firmware sould be kept as simple as possible, no realtime os, no dynamic configuration files, so the user can edit the c files and adapt it to their own configuration / keymaping needs.
The CMSIS and nuvoton NUC122 std libaries will be used.
