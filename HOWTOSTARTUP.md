Warning! Do NOT hit compile if don't want to overwrite your current firmware! The project is setup in such a way that if
"Compile and Upload" is selected instead of "Just Compile" it will automatically flash the firmware when you have your programming setup completed.
/\ This is not yet valid as automatic upload is not working /\


Run START_codeblocks_portable.bat, 
	which will launch CodeBlocks in a portable manner
	and will setup the project's compiler/debugger options correctely

then follow manual_flashing.md or (TODO not working yet automatic_flashing.md)
